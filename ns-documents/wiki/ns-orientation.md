Network School Orientation Guide
Everything You Need to Know If You Missed the Welcome Session — A Comprehensive Guide for New Members at Forest City, Malaysia

Welcome to Network School
Welcome to Network School (NS), a startup society and innovative community located in Forest City, Malaysia. Whether you're here for a month or planning to become a long-termer, this guide will help you navigate everything the community has to offer. NS operates on a simple philosophy: we're building 'society as a service,' taking all the friction out of your daily life so you can focus on what matters most to you.

The Daily Loop: Your Life at NS
Network School is structured around what's called the 'Daily Loop,' a seamless integration of living, working, learning, and wellness. Think of it as having all the infrastructure of life handled so you can pour your energy into your goals.

Key Spaces & Locations
Co-Working Space: Located separately from the main hotel, intentionally designed so you can get focused work done away from the social buzz. Monday programming happens here.

NS Lounge (13th Floor): Where lunch and dinner are served. Lunch bowls start at 11:30 AM, dinner buffet runs 5:30-8:00 PM.

Café (2nd Floor, Lobby Area): Open 7:00 AM to midnight daily. Great for work, hanging out, or grabbing food outside meal windows.

Gym: Open 24/7. Classes at 7 AM, 11 AM, and 5 PM daily (Sundays only 11 AM).

Ladies' Lounge (Room 1117): A private space for women. Men are asked to respect this boundary.

Lost & Found: Located on the 13th floor.

Ice Bath & Sauna: Available outside the main doors (more saunas coming, including one for the ladies' lounge).

Meals & Nutrition
Breakfast: Served in the first floor of the North Tower. Note: This is the only meal NS doesn't control the menu for, so there will be temptations. Be mindful if eating clean is your goal.

Lunch: Bowls served at the NS Lounge starting at 11:30 AM.

Dinner: Buffet at the NS Lounge, 5:30-8:00 PM.

Burn: The Wellness Program
Burn is NS's comprehensive wellness program, led by Sam (who's been here 15 months). The philosophy is simple: we do all the work on the backend so you just show up and see results. It's 'well-being as a service.'

Core Philosophy
Training vs. Working Out: Working out is showing up when you feel like it. Training is built on consistency and progression, where every workout has a function and purpose.

Four Pillars of Health & Longevity
Exercise (strength training, Zone 2 & Zone 5 cardio, stability work)

Sleep

Nutrition

Supplementation

Weekly Courses
Vibe Coding 101: Every Friday starting next week. Week 1 covers systems architecture: understanding how the internet works, how applications are built, and how servers and users work together. Perfect for learning to build apps with AI from scratch.

Machine Learning Fundamentals: Taught by member Jared. Complementary to Vibe Coding. Both courses include a hackathon later in the month.

Other Learning Opportunities
Ray Dalio Principles Workshop: Full-day workshop based on Dalio's principles. Take the 30-40 minute assessment beforehand. Workshop includes lunch and an afternoon talk by Balaji.

The NS Philosophy
"In life, perspective is one of the biggest learnings anyone could learn. What feels right to you may feel wrong to someone else — not because either is wrong, but because you have different facts, experiences, and contexts."

This community is built on the idea that we each bring limited information to any situation. When you learn to see from multiple perspectives, your ego diminishes and you become open-minded. There's always more to learn.

Final Notes
"NS is frontier, not fancy." Things will break. The path is slippery when it rains. The water temperature might spike. Some doors need a firm pull. But that's the deal when you're building something new.

Remember: Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will NS. Start with the V1 of something. Take initiative.

Welcome to Network School. We're glad you're here. Now let's build something together.
