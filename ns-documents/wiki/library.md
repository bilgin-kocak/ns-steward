Library
We recently started a new tradition: when members arrive at Network School, they bring and contribute books meaningful to them — something that inspired, challenged, or shaped them. This is completely optional and voluntary, but an easy way to immediately make a contribute to building the Network School.
It’ll go in the NS Library, a growing collection that reflects the diverse minds and values of our community. Whether you’re here short- or long-term, your book becomes part of the legacy.

Check out this post from Michael for more details. 
 
When you’re at the Network School, you can place the books you’re contributing to the shelf in NS Library (South Tower, Floor 3)
