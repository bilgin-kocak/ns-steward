Hi team, I’d like to report an incident that happened at the hotel gym and ask for your help to look into it.

Earlier today, I was working out at the first-floor hotel gym. There were three men there who were not behaving appropriately, so I politely asked them if they could stop. One of them — a white male, medium height, muscular — suddenly became very aggressive. He shouted at me, denied doing anything wrong, and called me ridiculous and crazy. The interaction was hostile and intimidating. After that, he left.

The other two men (one tall white male and one tall Black male) stayed. I later asked them whether they were from NS, and they said they were not. They claimed NS allowed them to use the gym and hang out at the hotel, but I’m not sure if that’s accurate. From my understanding, all three of them were outsiders.

As an Asian woman, I felt genuinely unsafe during this encounter. All three men were physically strong and acted aggressively toward me. Because of this, I no longer feel safe using the first-floor hotel gym, even though it’s usually more convenient for me than the NS gym on the third floor.

I’d like to kindly ask:
    
Do we officially allow non-NS outsiders to use the hotel gym equipment?
Could you please help look into this incident and possibly coordinate with the hotel management or facilities team? At the moment, there doesn’t seem to be anyone supervising the hotel gym.

I managed to take a photo of the two men who stayed (the tall white male and the tall Black male). The man who was verbally aggressive toward me left quickly, so I wasn’t able to get a photo of him.

Thank you for taking this seriously. I appreciate your help in ensuring a safe environment. @Yash @Jackson Steger @balajis @donovansung

Hi everyone, just a quick update.
Thank you so much for all the DMs and check-ins over the past few hours — I’m totally okay, please don’t worry 🤍

The NS core team helped me really quickly. We went back to the gym later, but those guys had already left. After looking into it, the team confirmed that those individuals were outsiders. The core team also let me know that additional security will be in place very soon, which I really appreciate. Stuff like this can happen, but the way the community handled it made me feel supported. Thank you to everyone working behind the scenes to help make NS a safer place.

Thanks again to everyone who reached out. Let’s keep looking out for each other, and if anything feels off, please don’t hesitate to ask for help.🙏

Avoiding security incidents, like the one from yesterday
Because something like this requires a human to be available at all times
⁠announcements⁠
Something harder to setup would be fingerprint/face access but doable regardless
Konrad — 11:28
i mean what is the benefit versus the non qr/nfc wrist bands.
Sid — 11:29
a human must be present at all times to verify the presence of the current band 
qr/nfc can be automated
Konrad — 11:29
still wouldn't stop someone from walk in without scanning qr/nfc wrist band
Sid — 11:30
if the door only opens when a qr code band is present then it could

to make it simpler it could just use face recognition as well, solutions exist for it already 
if someone tags along with a person with the band, then the person with the band can be held accountable

in essence this could be the mvp, and then the remaining gaps can be covered as they surface

I was just asking out of curiosity, to explore this idea. From my past experiences: I did this coding school called 42 it was a month long, and we had wrist bands for the dorms and the cowork space. At Edge City, we had wrist bands. To control access. ETHGlobal hackathons does nfc wrist bands, scan when getting food or demo, they call onchain functions, and they do some data aggregation from that, which is interesting. I just wanted to share my experiences on that.

Ah gotcha

I'm assuming that, at least for now, no records/database are being kept of comings and goings, and that we will get informed consent if anything is going to be recorded... definitely there are interesting Burn applications so we know who really went to the gym. Of course, with consent that info is collected.
Nick Chow — 11:48
My guess is that the cost of labour for having someone enforce the wirstband isn't a huge constraint.  So going with an NFC solution for the wristbands + having to buy the hardware to lock the doors + maintain/operate the gear isn't needed straight out of the gates.

👁️ The market still prices growth stories. Power is quietly repricing scarcity, production, and things that don’t need permission to exist.

Hey everyone!
I've noticed we have an incredible pool of creative talent here at NS, videographers, editors, motion designers, and storytellers. I'm making some content for NS and I'm looking to bring together creators to create some compelling content that showcases the stories, people, experiences etc that NS is home to.

Let's just get together, brainstorm some ideas, and see what we can make happen. If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me 🙂

Hi, if anybody finds a black notebook/diary that says 'Mudrex' on the cover, kindly place it in the lost and found desk. I had forgotten it at one of the tables by the pool today 🙂

I go to Eminent Reflexology at Bukhit Indah, by Grab or bus, for the Chinese Medicinal Massage. They are professional, clean and 10x more reliable than anything I've experienced in FC.

Does anyone have a few sheets of white paper they could spare? I'm flat out and apparently the hotel charges 50 cents / sheet 😅

And they serve food before and after the massage!!! 😂
electrafrost — 22:06
The free food and tea is unreal. A good massage is supposed to make you hungry afterwards. Now we know!

Eminent Reflexology also does free pick up sometimes, we tried yesterday, but they only offer pick up, you need to take your grab back
electrafrost — 22:23
Do you request that on their app or by Whatsapp?
