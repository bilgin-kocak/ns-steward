om_santo — 30.12.2025, 14:49
Hi everyone, i am Om

i am web3 dev from india, i recently won network state track in Zypherpunk hackathon and got bookings confirmed for NS for the february month

i haven't done onboarding yet, as i have some queries regarding travel

so as i am indian, i f i chose to travel via singapore i need to have singapore visa, and if i directly travel to malaysia, i don't require visa as it's visa free right?

so can i directly fly to kuala lumpur and from there is road transport available to NS or does NS provides any transport from kuala lumpur

please help me with this so i can then do my bookings accordingly and also i'll be flying abroad for the 1st time, so i need help with all these.. 
Aman — 30.12.2025, 15:20
No NS doesn't provide any road transport from Kuala Lumpur, it just has a shuttle service from Changi, Singapore on 1st of every month! For Singapore, you need to have a visa for entry and getting out of the airport, normally you'll get the visa for 2 years so its a good investment.
You can take private taxi if you decide to land in Malaysia or maybe partner up with someone coming to NS from Kuala Lumpur during the same time as you. But for your first trip I'd recommend you land in Changi, you'll have tons of stuff to do and see around right within the airport itself
om_santo — 30.12.2025, 15:24
thanks man
Konrad — 30.12.2025, 15:26
I flew into Johor Bahru Senai International Airport, it's only about 30 minute taxi ride from NS. It had a direct flight from Saigon where I was so it was better for me then to go via Singapore.

Abhay Shenoy — 30.12.2025, 17:59
Hey folks, I’m Shenoy.

I’m a filmmaker and creative director working in new media with startups and communities, mostly in San Francisco. I’ve helped scale The Residency in San Francisco and Localhost in India as their storyteller.

I thrive around builders and their indomitable energy. That environment consistently opens up new doors and collaborations for me.

I’m excited to scale my creative company, Tastefully, remotely during my time at Network School and to meet new people along the way.

I'm landing on the 31st at 11 AM (Johor Bahru Airport) 

Let’s connect: https://x.com/abhayshenoyx

@Robs Please add me to member channels :))

🎧 DJ Wanted – Welcoming Pool Party 🎉

Hey everyone!
We’re hosting a Welcoming Pool Party on Saturday, Jan 3rd at 4:30 PM by the pool 🌴

We’re currently looking for a DJ to help set the mood.
Some of our previous community DJs have moved on, so we’re wondering if there’s any new DJ around who’d like to jump in 👀

👉 You’ll need to bring your own DJ gear / controller.
If you’re interested (or know someone who might be), please DM me!

Thanks and see you at the pool 🏊‍♀️🍕🍹It’s a chill get-together for both newcomers and familiar faces — come grab some pizza, drinks, and good vibes.

Malaysian immigration hasn't asked me a single question (yet). 
I was once asked at Indian immigration and I just mentioned what's been written on the invitation letter, that it is an academic retreat program.

kosmostasis — 1.01.2026, 14:37
Hey fam, Koss here. 🌿 I've got a mixed background across the arts, grassroots activism, policy/gov relations, and have found kinship among social impact-enabling (technical) circles. I've co-instigated both tech startups and civic innovation spaces. Generally curious about our expansion as a multi-planetary civilization and a cat lover.

Been thinking of (and low-key working for) alt-nations my whole life, thanks to having the privilege of growing up in a failed state, where inflation has ranked sometimes in the +10,000,000 %/year and a third of the population has migrated by now.

RoohiSharma — 1.01.2026, 16:52
Hi y'all, Roohi here. Currently on a bus from Kaula Lampur to Johor Bharu. 

I'm currently based in Delhi, India. I am a computer science major from my undergraduate education and an education policy major from my master's degree. The last 15 years I have worked in the social impact space in India and the US both. 

I quit full time work as an Associate Director at India Leaders for Social Sector eight months ago where I first led the study and then created the flagship evidence-based Digital Transformation for Social Impact Program in India and ran its first cohort with 14 nonprofits before giving myself the permission to work on my own thing and quit full time salaried work (hopefully for good!!).

I'm working on my own entrepreneurial venture now and in the interim am also a women-centric, leadership and executive coach. While the women centric piece might sound gendered intentionally because of lived life experience, the leadership and executive pieces in my coaching practice are not. I'm also a non-custodial mom to an 8 year old. I look forward to learning from you all.
