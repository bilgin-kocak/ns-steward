I almost forgot! @mateusz is going to do a guided run/tour of Forest City tomorrow. This is a great way to stretch your legs and see more of the island.

Meet by the pool after the conclusion of the afternoon mixer.

Get to know where NS Coworking is, where to catch a bus, and where to eat out. Explore unbelievable flora and fauna and tap into the unusual life here. 4–5 km at a slow, easy pace.

@everyone if you haven’t seen the path to coworking, I’ll lead a walk from cafe at 12:40pm (in 18 minutes). 

At 1pm, Balaji will deliver the opening address for the December cohort.

Hey @everyone 

Today, @Ramiro will lead the first AI Assisted Development workshop in the library.

This is an incremental (4 parts) weekly course where you'll learn how to build and ship real applications using AI-powered development tools. This hands-on program takes you from understanding system architecture to deploying your own AI-enabled chat application with user authentication, database storage, and chat history.

​What You'll Build: By the end of the course, you'll have created and deployed a fully functional AI Assistant app that anyone can access at your own domain.

​Who This Is For: Anyone who want to leverage AI tools like Cursor to prototype solutions. No prior coding experience required, but a willingness to learn and experiment is essential.

Week 1: Introduction & Systems Architecture
​Week 2: Security Fundamentals & Version Control
​Week 3: Building with Data
Week 4: Building & Launching Your AI Assistant

Hi @everyone 

Announcing Chinese beginner lessons for everyone

Starting this Tuesday, we will offer beginner Chinese lessons to anybody who would like to attend. This will be a weekly class for the next four weeks in December. At the conclusion of those four weeks you will have the option to join our existing Chinese learning community, which will continue to meet on Wednesdays. Then in January, we will restart the Tuesday beginner classes to make way for a new cohort of total beginners.

Going to Breakpoint/UAE this next week?

Join the Telegram here. @nikkideyy and 30+ others will be in town and this can be a helpful way to coordinate with one another.

@everyone We have a v1 Ladies Lounge in 1117 👩‍🎨 

Room 1117 is a suite in the North Tower that is accessible to women at NS. It's a v1 women's space that can be used for coworking, hangouts, and other women-only events. There's also an outdoor patio which can be used for yoga and workouts as well. Over time, we'll add furniture and features to make this place cozier and vibey. Thank you to @Kate, @Josie, and the longtermer ladies that are helping with the initiative. 

How can women access this space? 🔑 

A hotel room can only have a few keycards so unfortunately, we can't currently give keycards to all female members. For now, women at NS can go to the reception and request them to open 1117. In the future, we'll replace the lock that makes it easier for folks to access this space. 

Note: Gentlemen, please do not try to crash this space. I repeat, this is a women-only space. 



Yash — 15.12.2025, 19:03
@everyone Welcome 100xDevs Bootcamp to Network School 🙌

We have over a dozen engineers joining NS as part of 100xDevs Bootcamp starting today. 100xDevs is a community that helps beginner engineers level up to become high skilled developers. If you see the 100xDev folks around campus, say hi and welcome them to the community.

Hear from Harkirat — founder of 100xDevs 🎙️ 

Harkirat is an IIT-Roorkee grad who's built a 1M+ audience across platforms. Tomorrow, he will do a talk focused on learning how to code in the AI era and building distribution that compounds. Sign up here.

We're looking forward to welcoming you to the campus 🤝 Browse ns.com/wiki which has a ton of info to help you settle in. If you are arriving outside the 10am to 10pm window, check-in at the reception. Also, check out @kuan yu's rideshare app that can help with transport logistics. 🚗

I'll do a make up orientation for folks arriving after 6pm on Jan 1st. More details on that soon. 

Quick update on room logistics for current members from @Dhairya Chheda (DC) 🏠

With the new cohort starting on January 1st, we’ll be prepping the rooms to get ready for the new arrivals.

If you are not renewing, please ensure you checkout by 9am on Dec 31st. For folks not renewing, room keys will be disabled at 11am so we can clean the rooms for Jan 1. If you need to access luggage or grab something from the room after that, just ask reception for one-time access.

Want to stay longer? You can renew right now at ns.com/pay. If you have any questions or logistical issues, DM @Dhairya Chheda (DC) or come find him in the cafe and we’ll get it sorted. Thank you.

@everyone Super-fast steamlined support: one platform for all support requests  📥 

Instead of having to find the right NS Core team member for your request, we now have one central support channel that routes your questions to the right person.

You can request support via:

Website: Use the chat widget in the bottom right corner at ns.com
Email: Send an email to support@ns.com for requests that need details or documentation
WhatsApp: DM us at +60-197407140 you prefer Whatsapp

All three connect to the same team, so use whichever works best for you 🤝 Using this new support platform will be much faster time-to-resolution for requests than pinging individual NS Core team members. 

That being said, the Core team is always available if there's time sensitive issues or if you just want to say hello when you see us on campus.

Jackson Steger — 30.12.2025, 18:37

Your participation is entirely voluntary and you may withdraw at any time. If you choose to participate, your involvement will help us better understand how enrollment in the Network School affects wellbeing, sleep, and daily routines.

Please fill out this survey to participate.

Hey @everyone 

We are adding a new security measure and security staff. You will now need a wristband to enter NS Campus (both coworking and the hotel).

Please come to the cafe between now and 11pm or tomorrow between 1:30 and 3:30pm in order to pick up your wristband. 

Sam — 10:51
@everyone 
Our team will be checking wristbands for access to Levels 3 and 13 to keep these areas exclusive to NS members. If you don’t have a wristband, show proof of access to the Network School Discord and our team will issue one.

We’ll keep this quick and frictionless. Our Core team is always available if you need help.

Jackson Steger — 14:34
Hey @everyone . Busy day tomorrow.

In addition to the burn classes at 7a, 11a, and 5p, there are 7 events on the calendar, including @Em Roblin 's Superpowers Unlocked workshop and @balajis opening talk. We'll serve lunch at coworking so you can go to both without missing a beat.

A reminder: To attend Em's session, you must take the free assessment at PrinciplesYou and email a PDF of your results to em@emroblin.com
